		Easyah is meant to bring folks together. We realize sometimes, to say the least, that's not meant to be.
		Still, communication is the key. Take some time to reach out to the other user, and see if this can be 
		worked out to everyone's satisfaction. <br/><br/>

		If you still now want to mark this incomplete, the other user will have the chance to weigh in one final
		time. If they still want to mark their side complete, then this request will be closed, and they will 
		receive half of the points you've put up.<br/><br/>For quality assurance and training purposes, this li'l mishap may
		be written to a database, so really try to work this out!
