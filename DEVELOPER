        No installed build tools found. Please install the Android build tools version 19.1.0 or higher.

    In that case, be sure $ANDROID_HOME is pointing to the correct dir. At press time that was ~/Android/Sdk. You may need to use the Android Studio IDE to do the installing. 

    If you need to accept licenses, try:

        /home/johnathan/Android/Sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses
