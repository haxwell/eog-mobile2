Next bug to address on iPhone..

you go to the profile, edit, and click Set Your Location.. it spins, and then the popup to request manual entry appears under, inaccesibly under, the loading Please Wait spinner.

Also, there was an issue where the profile showed 0 points, even though the home page showed 5. If we can't read the API for whatever reason, we should show -- there instead
